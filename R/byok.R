# Bring your own key (BYOK): the session-scoped credential layer.
#
# Users paste their own LLM API key in the app (Review tab). The key is held only
# in the Shiny session (a reactiveVal), passed straight to the ellmer constructor as
# `api_key` (never Sys.setenv - that is process-global and would leak across
# sessions on a hosted server), never written to disk, and redacted from any error
# surfaced to the UI. This honors CLAUDE.md rule #4 (no keys in the repo, none
# hardcoded): the key lives in memory for one session and nowhere else.
#
# A credential is a plain list(provider, api_key, model). byok_effective_config()
# folds it onto the static config as `provider` + per-provider `models` (from
# config.yml `byok:`) + `api_key`, so every existing LLM stage - which already
# threads `config` into build_chat() - picks up the user's provider, models, and
# key with no signature change, and it serializes cleanly into the mirai offload
# daemon (R/llm_offload.R) as a normal argument.

# The providers offered for BYOK: key-based only. google_vertex is intentionally
# excluded - it authenticates with OAuth / Application Default Credentials, not a
# pasteable key.
