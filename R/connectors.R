# The Connectors reference page: a human-facing catalog of every data source
# CANDID can pull a signal from, grouped by evidence domain, with each source's
# provider, role, selection status, and a one-line description. It reads the SAME
# catalog the engine and the source picker use (candid_source_catalog), so a source
# added to the registry shows up here automatically - the page can never silently
# omit a connector. Availability reflects the live environment (a key-gated source
# with no key reads "needs a key"). No engine logic here: presentation over the
# catalog metadata.

# One-line human descriptions + a homepage link per connector, keyed by signal key.
# This is the only page-specific content; a key without an entry still renders (from
# its catalog label/source), so the page degrades gracefully when a new connector
# lands before its blurb does.
