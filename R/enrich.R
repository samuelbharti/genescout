# Gene-list enrichment: pull a ranking signal from each source for every gene,
# merge and dedupe by canonical gene id, and shape the tidy + wide tables the
# ranking and UI consume. Deterministic, no LLM. In discovery mode a resolved
# disease context (context$disease) seeds extra candidate genes and makes the
# OT / ClinVar / PMC signals disease-specific; in plain enrichment the pull is
# gene-only. The free-text description is reserved for the later agent stage.
#
# A SIGNAL is one source's contribution, defined once in the registry:
#   candid_signal(key, label, source, extractor, normalize, weight, direction,
#                 role, needs)
# `role` is "evidence" (counts toward breadth) or "annotation" (nudges but does
# not gate); `needs` is "gene" (per-gene extractor), "disease" (a seeder, run
# before this step), "input" (derived from the input structure, no network -
# cross_source, filled by enrich_input_signals), or "network" (one call sees the
# WHOLE resolved set - STRING, filled by enrich_network_signals). Adding a source =
# one candid_signal() here plus its R/tools/ client. Each per-gene extractor
# returns a raw number + grounded evidence rows.

# Fill the `needs = "network"` signals (currently just STRING) from ONE call that
# sees the whole resolved set - unlike the per-gene extractors. For each network
# signal and every resolved gene, the raw value is the gene's within-list
# connectivity (how many OTHER resolved genes it shares a high-confidence STRING
# edge with); a connected gene is "present" and emits one grounded evidence row per
# interacting partner (domain "interaction", source_id "STRING:<a>-<b>"). Only
# genes that RESOLVED are sent to STRING (junk tokens are skipped). `fetch_network`
# is injectable so the fill is testable offline. A failed/absent network (or a gene
# past the STRING_MAX_NODES cap) leaves that gene's raw value NA - so it reads "no
# data" in the report, never a measured "0 interactions" - and absent (annotation
# neutral, composites unchanged); only a gene STRING was actually asked about and
# returned isolated gets a grounded degree 0. Returns signals_long / evidence_long
# (as enrich_genes() does) plus `capped` (non-NULL when the query was truncated).
