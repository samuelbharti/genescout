# two so the UI can re-rank on a weight change without re-querying:
#   run_enrich(): flatten -> resolve to canonical ids (dedupe) -> enrich
#     (per-source signals) -> citation gate -> assemble the gene x signal matrix.
#   rank_result(): compute composite (with optional weight override) -> rank ->
#     grade. Pure and cheap.
