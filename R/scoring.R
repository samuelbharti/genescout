# Composite technical ranking.
#
# Each source contributes a normalized [0,1] signal; the composite is a WEIGHTED
# MEAN across all registry signals, where a missing signal contributes 0 to the
# numerator but its weight stays in the denominator. So a gene supported broadly
# but moderately outranks one that is famous in a single source - this is what
# structurally defeats the familiar-gene bias.
#
# Weights and normalization midpoints live in rubric.yml (edit there to retune -
# no code change). Everything here is pure and deterministic, so rankings are
# reproducible run-to-run and independent of which other genes are in the list.

# Load the ranking rubric (per-signal weights + normalization midpoints).

# --- Composite + rank -------------------------------------------------------

# Weighted mean of the normalized per-signal columns (`<key>_n`) over the
# registry, role-aware:
#   - EVIDENCE signals: weight is always in the denominator, so a missing one
#     contributes 0 to the numerator but still divides - breadth is rewarded and
#     a narrow-but-famous gene is structurally beaten by a broadly-supported one.
#   - ANNOTATION signals (e.g. constraint, druggability, connectivity): only ever
#     nudge the score UP. Each gene's present annotations are folded into its mean
#     greedily, largest normalized value first, and one is included ONLY while it is
#     at least the gene's RUNNING composite at that point - so an inclusion can
#     never pull the mean down. An absent or a below-running annotation is neutral.
#     This makes "annotations only nudge up" a hard guarantee: a gene is never
#     ranked below an otherwise-identical gene for carrying an extra, weaker
#     annotation (gating on the fixed evidence-only mean instead would let an
#     annotation between that floor and the running mean drag the composite down).
# `weights` (a named key -> weight vector) overrides the registry weights, which
# is how the live UI sliders re-rank without re-querying. `coverage_bonus`
# optionally rewards genes supported by many EVIDENCE sources.
